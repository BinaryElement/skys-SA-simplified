[mod-setting-description]
sssa-unlock-all-qualities=All qualities (uncommon to legendary) will be unlocked with the Automation technology.
sssa-revert-module-recipes=Module recipes will be reverted to base game - ie the extra item (such as tungsten carbide) are removed.
sssa-revert-cliff-explosive-recipe=Cliff Explosives recipe will be reverted to base game.  This allows them to be crafted from Nauvis resources, but you will still have to go off-planet to learn the technology.
sssa-rocket-parts-per-rocket=How many rocket parts you need to build to launch a rocket.  Vanilla default is 50, Simplified SA default is 10.
sssa-rockets-only-need-fuel=Removes LDS and Processing Units from the Rocket Part recipe.  In other words, you can launch rockets by giving the silo fuel alone.
sssa-easy-space-foundations=Space Foundations are cheaper and faster to craft, and stack higher in the rocket.
sssa-pld-nerf-revert=The 2.0 update reduced PLD damage by 66%.  This setting reverses that change.
sssa-nutrients-lifetime-multiplier=Multiplies the spoilage timer by the given number.  If set to zero, removes spoilage completely.
sssa-nutrients-no-spoilage-result=If enabled, Nutrients will spoil into nothing instead of spoilage.
sssa-nutrients-burnable=Allow nutrients to be burned - useful for overflow control via heating towers.
sssa-easter-egg=Adds items/recipes/easter eggs/etc useful for the editor.

sssa-remove-nauvis-location-requirements=Remove Nauvis location requirement from Biolab placement.
sssa-capture-rocket-no-bioflux=Capture Rocket costs Nutrients instead of Bioflux
sssa-captured-biters-food-type=Choose which type of food captive biter spawners require.  Using nutrients allows positive feedback loop via converting eggs to nutrients - unrealistic, maybe, but so is the rest of this mod.

sssa-remove-vulcanus-location-requirements=Remove Vulcanus location crafting requirement from Foundries and Big Mining Drills
sssa-remove-vulcanus-material-requirements=Remove tungsten carbide from the recipes for Foundries and Big Mining Drills
sssa-remove-calcite-from-melting-ores=Remove Calcite from the recipe to melt ores into molten metals
sssa-revert-artillery-recipes=Revert the recipe for artillery, artillery wagons, and artillery shells to base game.  This allows them to be crafted from Nauvis resources, but you will still have to go off-planet to learn the technology.

sssa-remove-fulgora-location-requirements=Remove Fulgora location crafting requirement from EM Plant and Recyclers.
sssa-remove-stone-from-liquid-recipes=Remove stone from the recipes for Holmium Solution and Electrolyte

sssa-remove-gleba-location-requirements=Remove Gleba location crafting requirement from Biochambers.  This option will not be very helpful without also enabling "Remove Biochamber Pentapod Req"
sssa-remove-biochamber-pentapod-requirement=Biochamber will no longer require pentapod eggs.  This is kind of mandatory if you want to fully remove location requirements from crafting it.
sssa-gleba-science-lifetime-multiplier=Multiplies the spoilage timer by the given number.  If set to zero, removes spoilage completely.
sssa-gleba-science-no-spoilage-result=If enabled, Agricultural Science Packs will spoil into nothing instead of spoilage.  This removes the need to clear spoilage from your labs.
sssa-gleba-agriculture-anywhere=Allows you to place artificial soils anywhere, instead of only on their respective wetland.
