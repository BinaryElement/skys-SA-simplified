[mod-setting-description]
sssa-unlock-all-qualities=All qualities (uncommon to legendary) will be unlocked with the Automation technology.
sssa-revert-module-recipes=Module recipes will be reverted to base game - ie the extra item (such as tungsten carbide) are removed.
sssa-revert-cliff-explosive-recipe=Cliff Explosives recipe will be reverted to base game.  This allows them to be crafted from Nauvis resources, but you will still have to go off-planet to learn the technology.
sssa-rocket-parts-per-rocket=How many rocket parts you need to build to launch a rocket.  Vanilla default is 50, Simplified SA default is 10.
sssa-rockets-only-need-fuel=Removes LDS and Processing Units from the Rocket Part recipe.  In other words, you can launch rockets by giving the silo fuel alone.
sssa-easy-space-foundations=The Space Foundation recipe yield is increased by 10x.  Space Foundations also have increased stack size, and will stack higher in the rocket.
sssa-pld-nerf-revert=The 2.0 update reduced PLD damage by 66%.  This setting reverses that change.
sssa-nutrients-lifetime-multiplier=Multiplies the spoilage timer by the given number.  If set to zero, removes spoilage completely.
sssa-nutrients-no-spoilage-result=If enabled, Nutrients will spoil into nothing instead of spoilage.
sssa-nutrients-burnable=Allow nutrients to be burned - useful for overflow control via heating towers.
sssa-easter-egg=Adds items/recipes/easter eggs/etc useful for the editor.

sssa-asteroid-health-multiplier=The health of asteroids will be multiplied by this value, and rounded up if decimal.  Smaller numbers mean weaker asteroids.
sssa-downgrade-asteroid-defenses=The number of times asteroid resistances are downgraded.\n\nWhat a downgrade means is that for each level of meteor its resistances will change to the asteroid size before it.\n\nFor example, with one downgrade medium asteroids will have their resistances dropped to match vanilla small asteroids.  Similarly, big asteroids will have their resistances dropped to match vanilla medium asteroids.  Small asteroids will have their resistances removed.\n\nReducing resistances twice or more will do the same thing again.  At the highest amount of reductions all resistances will be removed from all asteroids.\n\nNegative values will reverse this process, resulting in stronger asteroids.

sssa-remove-nauvis-location-requirements=Remove Nauvis location requirement from Biolab placement.
sssa-capture-rocket-no-bioflux=Capture Rocket costs Nutrients instead of Bioflux
sssa-captured-biters-food-type=Choose which type of food captive biter spawners require.  Using nutrients allows positive feedback loop via converting eggs to nutrients - unrealistic, maybe, but so is the rest of this mod.

sssa-remove-vulcanus-location-requirements=Remove Vulcanus location crafting requirement from Foundries, Big Mining Drills, and Turbo Belts.
sssa-remove-vulcanus-material-requirements-foundry=Remove or replace (with plastic) the Tungsten Carbide required to craft Foundries.
sssa-remove-vulcanus-material-requirements-bmd=Remove or replace (with plastic) the Tungsten Carbide required to craft Big Mining Drills.
sssa-remove-vulcanus-material-requirements-belts=Remove or replace (with steel) the Tungsten Steel required to craft Turbo Belts.
sssa-remove-calcite-from-melting-ores=Remove Calcite from the recipe to melt ores into molten metals
sssa-remove-calcite-from-lava-metals=Remove Calcite from the recipe to obtain molten metals from lava
sssa-revert-artillery-recipes=Revert the recipe for artillery, artillery wagons, and artillery shells to base game.  This allows them to be crafted from Nauvis resources, but you will still have to go off-planet to learn the technology.

sssa-remove-fulgora-location-requirements=Remove Fulgora location crafting requirement from EM Plant and Recyclers.
sssa-remove-fulgora-material-requirements-emp=Remove or replace (with iron plates) holmium plates from the recipe for Electromagnetic Plant
sssa-remove-stone-from-liquid-recipes=Remove stone from the recipes for Holmium Solution and Electrolyte

sssa-remove-gleba-location-requirements=Remove Gleba location crafting requirement from Biochambers.  This option will not be very helpful without also enabling "Remove Biochamber Pentapod Req".
sssa-remove-gleba-material-requirements-biochamber=Remove or replace (with biter eggs) the pentapod egg required to craft Biochamberse.
sssa-remove-gleba-material-requirements-inserter=Remove or replace (with plastic) the jelly and carbon fiber required to craft Stack Inserters.
sssa-gleba-science-lifetime-multiplier=Multiplies the spoilage timer by the given number.  If set to zero, removes spoilage completely.
sssa-gleba-science-no-spoilage-result=If enabled, Agricultural Science Packs will spoil into nothing instead of spoilage.  This removes the need to clear spoilage from your labs.
sssa-gleba-agriculture-anywhere=Allows you to place artificial soils anywhere, instead of only on their respective wetland.

sssa-remove-aquilo-location-requirements=Remove Aquilo location crafting requirement from Cryogenic Plants.
sssa-remove-planetary-material-requirements-cryo=Remove or replace (with plastic and iron) the superconductor and lithium ingredients in the recipe for Cryogenic Plant.
sssa-easy-foundations=The Foundation recipe yield is increased by 10x. Foundations also will stack higher in the rocket.
sssa-alternate-foundation-recipe=Allows changing the recipe of Foundations to an alternate cost with different location requirements.
