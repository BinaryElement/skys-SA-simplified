# What is Sky's Simplified Space Age?
Sky's Simplified Space Age is a basic mod which makes Space Age easier to play.
It does this primarily through simplifying recipes and reducing the amount of interplanetary logistics needed.

### Nobody wants this.  Why are you making this?
I had the idea when I got annoyed at foundries needing to be made on Volcanus, but I didn't actually begin making this mod until I mentioned it to a friend who had <100 hours on Factorio and she immediately begged me to do it.
